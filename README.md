Health Insurance Premium Cost Prediction



This repo includes a dataset representing health insurance premium costs for individuals. It uses information such as age, sex, bmi, and smoking habits to determine the cost on the insurance company for that person.

The idea is to present a machine learning model that predicts the premium cost with the best accuracy.
By deriving the coorelation from the dataset, it is observed that there is a strong relation between charges and the category whether the person is smoker or not (around 70% coorelation)
